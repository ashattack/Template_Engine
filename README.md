# Template_Engine - Employee Summary

 In this homework assignment, I built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 
 The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 


The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```
